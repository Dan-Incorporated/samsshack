## SETUP SCRIPTS

These scripts are used to help set up your project. You may or may not need all of them but they
will be listed out here.

NOTE: These scripts will (hopefully) work from any working directory, however they function best
when run from the `root` directory.

### initialize.sh

Basic project set up. Necessary to replace imports, fill in project name, add any required generated
files, etc.

### initialize_git.sh *

Used to set up git repository on GitHub. Will add it to
the [Dan-Incorporated](https://github.com/Dan-Incorporated) org to take advantage of shared runners
and shared config and all that fun stuff.

#### KEY

*
    - Optional script. Might as well use it though!
