### Description

TODO - fill out description

#### Specs

- Flutter 2.8.1 - to change simply find and search "2.8.1" throughout the project i.e., CI, CD, FVM,
  etc.
- Dart >=2.12.0 <3.0.0 - to change go to `pubspec.yaml`

### Setup

TODO - instructions for how to set up this to run locally for other devs

1. Setup [FVM](https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm) by running `fvm install` in the root directory and
   it will install the appropriate Flutter version for that project.
    - If using Android Studio, you will need to point it to the downloaded FVM SDK which will be in
      your project directory.
2. Create `.env` file at `assets/env/.env`.
3. Run the Flutter app on Android, iOS or web using the `flutter run` command.

### Deployment

TODO - add the simplest description of how to deploy/update site for other devs

#### Web deployment general instructions:

1. run `flutter build web` to produce output at `./build/web`
2. copy said `web` directory to hosted folder (S3, GitHub pages, etc.)

#### Mobile deployment general instructions:
